              Digital payments are transactions that take place via digital or
              online modes, with no physical exchange of money involved. This
              means that both parties, the payer and the payee, use electronic
              mediums to exchange money.

              UPI is a payment system that culminates numerous bank accounts
              into a single application, allowing the transfer of money easily
              between any two parties. As compared to NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS, UPI
              is far more well-defined and standardized across banks. You can
              use UPI to initiate a bank transfer from anywhere in just a few
              clicks.
